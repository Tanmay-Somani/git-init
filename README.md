## About

Welcome to the repos! This project aims to automate the process of privatizing your own repository effortlessly. By setting up this automation, you can seamlessly switch your repository's visibility to private, eliminating any manual steps or hassle.

## Features

- Easy setup: Follow the simple steps outlined in this README to configure the automation.
- Continuous integration: Leverage the power of CI/CD to trigger repository privatization automatically.
- Secure handling of sensitive information: Utilize environment variables to store access tokens and repository information securely.

## Getting Started

To get started with repository privatization, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. [Obtain an access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with the necessary repository permissions.
3. Set up environment variables for your access token and repository information.
4. Configure the CI/CD pipeline to trigger automation on specific events (e.g., pushes to a branch).
5. Customize the automation script to match your repository and branch names.
6. Commit and push the CI/CD pipeline configuration file.
7. Watch as your repository is automatically privatized!

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, the automation will handle the privatization process for you. Whenever the defined event occurs, such as a push to a specific branch, the repository will be seamlessly switched to private, eliminating any manual intervention.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or bug reports, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's collaborate to make this automation even better!
